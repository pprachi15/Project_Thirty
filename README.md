# Thirty Days. Thirty Problems. Thirty Business Solutions.

## Introduction
30 Day Applied Business Strategy Challenge is a personal initiative where I solve one real world business problem every day for thirty days.  
The goal is not to write code for the sake of code. The goal is to think like someone who belongs inside a strong team, someone who can take an ambiguous problem, understand the business impact, design a structured approach, and deliver a usable solution.

## 🌟 This challenge brings together the skills I care about most:
- problem solving  
- strategic thinking  
- project management  
- clear communication  
- data driven validation  
- continuous learning  
Every problem I pick reflects the kind of challenge that real teams face across fintech, consulting, operations, strategy, and product management.

## 🌟 Each day follows the same core structure:
- What is the business problem  
- Why does it matter  
- Who does it impact  
- What questions do we need to answer  
- What approach makes sense  
- What is the outcome or recommendation  

Some solutions require analytics.  
Some require reasoning, planning, prioritisation, or risk assessment.  
Some require forecasting or modelling.  
Some require creating a process that teams can follow.

The focus is not on the tool, but on the thinking behind the solution. My goal is to become the type of person who does not wait for instructions, but who takes initiative, breaks down complexity, and adds clarity wherever something is unclear.
At the end of thirty days, I want a portfolio that shows not just technical skills, but judgment, reasoning, and the ability to solve problems that actually matter to a business.
